Script for processing [ISmapper](https://github.com/jhawkey/IS_mapper) output files (slightly modified version of [this](https://github.com/aurbn/IS_mapper/blob/master/scripts/compiled_table.py) script)
We modified the script **compiled_table.py** in order to keep all the hits considered by ISMapper as inaccurate. Here an alternative method for merging hits is used: to be merged an intersection of ranges or both ends of new hit should be placed within tolerance (default, -1 b.p.) from any existing hit. All additional inaccurate hits being marked either as “closest”, “intersect” or “inside the other” depending on what bed file they came from.
